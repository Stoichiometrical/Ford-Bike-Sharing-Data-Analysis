</span><span class="s1"># Part I - FordGo Bike Sharing System Data 2019 
## by David Tendai Gondo 
 
## Introduction 
&gt; This dataset contains data about the individual bike rides people booked in the year 2019 in the area covering San Francisco . We are to visualize the data to get insights on the attributes of people who take longer bike rides to enable a targeted marketing campaign to increase thier numbers. 
 
#### What is the combination of attributes that lead to users who take longer bike rides? 
 
### Univariate Analysis 
**What is the distribution of the various attributes in the concerned bike ride duration zone** 
 
### Bivariate Analysis 
**What are the relationships that exists between these attributes** 
 
### Multivariate Analysis 
**What combination of these attributes make up the desired user persona**

</span><span class="s1">### What is the structure of your dataset? 
The dataset contains details of 175 147 individual bike rides in the Ford Go Bike Sharing System in the area covering San Francisco 
The data has attributes which give us bike usage insights and user type insights. 
The start_time , end_time , duration_sec,start_station, end_station and bike_id columns give us usage insights 
The age, user_type,member_gender and  bike_share_for_all_trip columns give us user attributes insights 
 
### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset? 
 
I am interested in identifying the attributes that influence  a longer bike duration time. 
### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest? 
 
The user attributes columns will help me to identify the correct combination of attributes that lead to a greater bike duration time .Therefore l am using all user attributes columns to discover out thier influence on a usage attribute : duration time . I anticipate that more younger male customers will have greater  bike duration times

</span><span class="s1">### Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations? 
 
&gt; I discovered that most of our users are adults between the ages of 25 and 40. They are mostly male . 
 &gt; Most users who take longer trip rides are on subscription. I also found out that most users do not bike share for the entire trip , possibly because most of the trips have a very short duration around 300 to 800 seconds. This begs the question to explore the type of activities our users might be using the bike sharing system. 
 
 
### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this? 
 
&gt; The frequency distribution of duration seconds was quite unusual because l expected a normal distribution.But it turned out to be left-skewed. 
&gt; I removed a some columns which were not going to be useful to our investigation like co-ordinates, these would require extra work to find the place on a map and identify them .Instead l kept the station names as they would be a better indicator for user concentration 
&gt; I had to transform the member birth year column into ages instead because the years on thier own were not very useful ,so  l calculated the ages of the users and used that to see the user age group range. 
&gt; l also separated the data into two parts, df and df2, the first for people who take longer trips and the latter for people who take comparably shorter trips.This has allowed to specifically look at the attributes where our main interest lie, ie increasing the number of people who take longer trips

&gt; I saw that as the time duration increases, the concentration of users become more sparse.Females tend to get fewer for longer times. 
&gt; There are more subscribers than customers who take longer bike rides.And the concentration of subscribers decrease less signficantly than those of customers as the time duration increases. It was also interesting to note that  although we have more female subscribers than male ,majority  of the few men subscribers are the ones who take the signficantly longer trips. 
&gt; There is no correlation between age and trip duration however users between the ages of 25 and 40  tend to have longer trips

&gt; I observed that our users tend to become less and less as time duration increases but the rate of decrease in number of users is less for male subscribers between the ages of 25 and 35.Usually these males dont share thier trips.They usually go to stations in differnt locations on Market Street.So these are our target users.With who we can optimize to target our marketing in the identified location of thiers highest occurances 
&gt; Users are mainly concentrated in short durations and our goals is to increase user density on the higher duration time scale by marketing to those people with similar traits or reletively similar attributes .

</span><span class="s1">## Conclusions 
&gt;You can write a summary of the main findings and reflect on the steps taken during the data exploration. 
My research was to analyse the features common to users who take longer bike rides so that l can come up with a target persona that can be used by Ford Go to create a marketing campaign targeting these types of users.I found out that thes users are mainly male subscribers between the ages of 25 and 35 and most of them dont share bike trips. I also found out that Market Street stations recieve a high incidence of these users. 
During my exploration l first removed data that was missing values in two important columns(member gender and age). This made up 4.5% of the data so it was not very signficant to the overall dataset.I then removed any irrelevant columns that did not contain the attributes of users or thier usage insights.From this stage l was also able to get a high level overview of the data l had and was able to group it into user attributes and usage insights. 
My univariate exploration was based on trying to understand the distribution of attributes along the users of interest.So l first identified the appropriate time range to call long. Then went on to identify how user and usage attributes where distributed in this range. From this l was able to identify some traits that could be worth furthur consideration in our bivariate exploration.From this l found out that most of our users where adults between 25 and 40 and where mostly male. I also found out that very few people share rides. 
In bivariate exploration , l then looked for relationships that existed between the attributes l identified earlier.Here it was interesting to note that as time duration increases the concentration of users become less and females become significantly fewer than males yet we had more females in the subscriber type than males .It was also interesting to note that age didnt have any effect on how long a person took a ride for. 
&gt; From bivariate exploration l now knew which features affected high bike duration so l started combining them to see thier overall effect if they were combined in one user.Here thats l observed that  of our subscribers, the most prominent ones were males who took longer rides. Since age had no influence on bike duration, l analysed it independely to see the distribution of our users on an age scale.Then l made my final conclusions based upon the overall influence of combined features on a users.
