# FordGo Bike Sharing System Data 2019
## by David Tendai Gondo


## Dataset
>The dataset contains data about the individual bike rides people booked in the year 2019 in the area covering San Francisco
>During my exploration l first removed data that was missing values in two important columns(member gender and age). This made up 4.5% of the data so it was not very signficant to the overall dataset.I then removed any irrelevant columns that did not contain the attributes of users or thier usage insights.From this stage l was also able to get a high level overview of the data l had and was able to group it into user attributes and usage insights. 

## Summary of Findings
>My research was to analyse the features common to users who take longer bike rides so that l can come up with a target persona that can be used by Ford Go to create a marketing campaign targeting these types of users.I found out that thes users are mainly male subscribers between the ages of 25 and 35 and most of them dont share bike trips. I also found out that Market Street stations recieve a high incidence of these users.
> My univariate exploration was based on trying to understand the distribution of attributes along the users of interest.So l first identified the appropriate time range to call long. Then went on to identify how user and usage attributes where distributed in this range. From this l was able to identify some traits that could be worth furthur consideration in our bivariate exploration.From this l found out that most of our users where adults between 25 and 40 and where mostly male. I also found out that very few people share rides. In bivariate exploration , l then looked for relationships that existed between the attributes l identified earlier.Here it was interesting to note that as time duration increases the concentration of users become less and females become significantly fewer than males yet we had more females in the subscriber type than males .It was also interesting to note that age didnt have any effect on how long a person took a ride for. From bivariate exploration l now knew which features affected high bike duration so l started combining them to see thier overall effect if they were combined in one user.Here thats l observed that of our subscribers, the most prominent ones were males who took longer rides. Since age had no influence on bike duration, l analysed it independely to see the distribution of our users on an age scale.Then l made my final conclusions based upon the overall influence of combined features on a users.

## Key Insights for Presentation
>Majority of our users take bike rides shorter than 4000 secs.The distribution of our users and trip duration is left skewed towards shorter times
> Males generally take longer trips than females
> Our target users are male subscribers between the ages of 25 and 35.
> These males usually dont share trips and have a frequency mainly around stations in Market Street
